# Styles Conference



I am learning Full Stack development.
Here I will post my progress in my studies and projects that I have implemented.

This is my **first** html and css practice project.


Here I honed the skill of dividing the site into rows and columns. I also honed my commenting skills. 
Positioning here was done using "float". 


That's all! Smile and work in your spare time!
